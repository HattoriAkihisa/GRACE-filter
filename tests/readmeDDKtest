This directory contains the following test scenario:
input:GSM-2_2008122-2008153_0030_EIGEN_G---_0004in (GRACE potential residuals)

After applying the filtermatrix Wbd_2-120.a_1d13p_4

we should have the following output:

GSM-2_2008122-2008153_0030_EIGEN_G---_0004out

The standard deviations shown are derived from a simple (diagonal errors only) error propagation.
